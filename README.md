# DietMC - Minecraft Jar Optimizer

DietMC is a tool designed to optimize Minecraft jar files by compressing images and replacing certain files within the jar. This can help reduce the file size of Minecraft installations, leading to faster loading times and improved performance.

## Installation

To use DietMC, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    bash
    

-   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DietMC.git` 
    
-   **Install dependencies:**
    
    DietMC requires Python 3.x and the Pillow library. You can install dependencies using pip:
    
-   `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    
-   **Run the script:**
    
    Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the main script:
    
    bash
    

1.  `cd DietMC
    python dietmc.py` 
    
2.  **Follow the prompts:**
    
    The script will prompt you to enter the location of your Minecraft versions directory. Enter the path to your Minecraft directory and press Enter.
    
3.  **Wait for optimization:**
    
    DietMC will analyze and optimize the jar files found in your Minecraft versions directory. Depending on the size of your installation, this process may take some time.
    
4.  **Enjoy your optimized Minecraft:**
    
    Once the optimization process is complete, you can launch Minecraft as usual (rememeber to turn off internet to skip file verification). You should notice faster loading times and potentially improved performance.
